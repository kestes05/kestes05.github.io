Official Dropbox for K. Estes
Thank you for visiting my dropbox: This will detail my various projects that I create during, and after, the learning process. This README will also be updated as new projects are made.
An official landing page will be created within the next few months (as of 02.07.2019)

Currently in the dropbox:
  Home Page:  a test landing page that was created to allow me to experiment with HTML and CSS, along with a bit of JS to demonstrate my abilities in HTML and CSS. It contains mainly trivial information, but will be expanded to include actual content.
  Complete Javascript Course - Dice Game, Project 1: My first project, coded during a lecture series. Code along style of learning, as hands-on works best for me. It is a fully functional "Pig" dice game, with two players, and the ability to roll the dice, hold your current score, and start a new game. Additional changes will come in the next few days (as of 02.07.2019).

UPDATES:
02.07.2019 - completed first project, and loaded to the dropbox. It is the current landing point for my dropbox, when people click on the page link.
